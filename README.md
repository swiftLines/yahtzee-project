Yahtzee is a game that I enjoyed playing growing up. A player starts with five dice to roll three times per turn. After each roll a player selects which dice that they want to keep. To score as high as possible have a category in mind and select all five dice best suited for that category by the end of your turn of three rolls. A category can only be choosen once per game.

Begin the game by clicking the click here message at the top of the screen.  Then click the roll button to roll the dice.  Click on the dice after each turn that you want to select towards your category goal. After your turn click on the category you want to apply your selected dice towards. Then the second player will need to repeat the same steps. After the second player is done with their turn the round is complete. A current total will be displayed for the player currently rolling. The game will end after thirteen rounds, and the player with the highest score wins.
